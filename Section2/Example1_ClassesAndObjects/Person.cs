    // | Declaring a class is a blueprint for creating objects.                        |
    // | After you declare a class, you may declare and instantiate objects.           |
    // | The definition of a class describes the structure of its instance objects.    |
    // | You can instantiate (create) as many objects as you want from one class.      |
